Nanny.Services — Babysitter Marketplace (React + Vite)
---
A babysitter catalog with authentication, protected favorites, and appointment booking via modal forms.
Routing is handled with React Router. Forms use react-hook-form + Yup validation. UI includes reusable modal and error components (page / inline), animations via Framer Motion, and styling via CSS Modules.

This is a React project bootstrapped with Vite.
